# Behavioral Evolution

## Lecture 1 (Intro):

A well-to-do man punches his wife in the face. Why? Is he a creep or might he have some weird brain tumor?

What does having your period, having a brain tumor, taking anabolic steroids, and eating junk food have in common? Hormones?
All have been used to justify murder in court cases.

Female aggression comes with periods - amygdala. If a tumor there, could cause violence.

2 main points in the course:

Sometimes what goes on in the body dramatically affects the brain (thoughts, behaviors, etc). 
Sometimes what goes on in the brain affects the body. Physiology and psychology are intertwined.

Making sense of human behavior is a complicated mess. We need a strategy to tackle this subject. Categories of thought will help explain it.

We calculate length by making comparisons with the length of things we understand.

We impose categories on things that are not categorical. Ex: color - infinite amount of colors in a continuum, but we have color wheels, etc. Categorical thinking makes storing away that info way easier.

Different labels beget different understanding - different languages describe things differently.

Thinking in categories makes things easier to understand, but has problems. Ex: sounds, phonemes. Different languages have different phonemes, and this affects your ability to remember words, sounds, etc. In Finnish, b and p are not differentiated.

Pay too much attention to categories, and you miss differentials within the same category. (b and p - bear and pear)

Ask to write down phone numbers, and then throw in random number groupings, and people get screwed up because the number grouping is different. Mixing of categories is attributed to this error.

Goal of this class is to understand behavioral biology without falling into categorical thinking.

Why does the chicken cross the road? To get to the rooster. To make an egg. Different specialties like genetics or psychology answer this question differently based on their categories.

We look at how physiology influences psychology and vice versa.

We will look at what the behavior looks like, and what happened a second before that behavior happened - it happened because this thing in the brain happened - because this environmental stimulus made it happen - because this hormone made that happen - epi/genetics made that happen… all different ways of expressing the same biological influences. 

Each category is an easy and convenient way to explain the same thing, and there’s more than one explanation. This is easy to forget, even in professional circles.

Behaviorism says that if you can control rewards, punishment, experience, etc., you’ll be able to change a person into anything you want. However, there are many fudge factors that invalidate this.

Normal psychic life is a result of synapses, and synaptic adjustments can result in disorders. Electroshock therapy, frontal lobotomies - done to thousands of people with nothing wrong with them. 

Explaining the world through one category is damaging, and can lead to maladies.

We have three intellectual challenges.

We’re not special: we’re like all the other animals and we have to accept that.
Ex: hamsters lengthening and syncing ovulation cycles through olfaction (pharomones). Humans do this too.

First half of the course introduces different categories of thinking.
Second half rips apart the categories.

Lecture 2 (Behavioral evolution 1):

Just given two skulls, an osteologist (bone scientist) can determine a plethora of things about those animals: which is male or female, which is more likely to cheat on their mates, which has aggressive tendencies, which has been malnourished or pregnant, life expectancies, and a bunch of other stuff, all by applying a base set of logic underlying all of those properties.

Giraffes have long necks, and thus need big, strong hearts with thick walls to pump blood up that neck, and those inferences can be accurately made even before it’s proven. There is an inevitable, inescapable logic behind this, because evolution optimizes a solution to these problems.

There are different realms of logic for these, but they all say the same thing. It’s all about optimization, and behavior is also optimized (Nash equilibrium). This is known as sociobiology.

Darwin didn’t discover evolution, but discovered the mechanism behind evolution. Traits in populations change over time enough to form new species. The logic is based on several simple facts. It is built on heritable genetic traits, and there is variability within those traits, and some are more optimal, more adaptable than others. It’s not a matter of survival, but reproduction of max amount of offspring possible. More offspring = more variability = more adaptability.

Large changes come from mutation. These are the building blocks of evolution and these can be applied to behavior.

bh = behavior/s

Some bh are heritable and have genetic components. The more adaptable bh are more prevalent.

How to apply this? How would X optimize the # genes to pass on? What organism X wants to do is pre-programmed based on optimization of # genes passed on.

Watching a wildlife doc - lions chewing on dead thing - they have to divvy up the food between themselves. 

Migration of zebras to flock to greener grass - river between them and next field that’s filled with crocs. Out comes a solution: elderly animal (zebra, wildebeest) sacrifices himself to the crocs so the rest can get away (Winn Edward, group selection). 

This is “good of the species” bh - trash this idea immediately! Animal bh instead based on passing on as many gene copies as possible, the wildebeest’s bh looks like “for the good of the species” bh. The elderly animal is being pushed from behind, not sacrificing himself.

Animals behave to maximize number of genes - 3 ways of making sense of social behavior from a biological standpoint: 
Individual selection - self-reproduction, drive to reproduce - passing on your own genes. “Sometimes a chicken is an egg’s way of making another egg.” This plays out in a number of ways. Natural selection brings about variability. 

Sexual selection sometimes selects for survival-irrelevant traits. Greater distrib of genes for big antlers, bright coloration etc. result, simply because the opposite sex likes those features, even if they’re harmful to the animal.


Kin selection - inclusive fitness - helping relatives pass on their genes - siblings share more genes than other group members. The closer a relative, the more genes are shared. If you forgo reproducing so your identical twin can reproduce more, this will pass on more genes. 

Different relatives differ in how many genes they share with you. “I will gladly lay down my life for 2 brothers or 8 cousins.” Out of this comes kin selection. Relates to obsession with kinship. Researchers made recordings of monkey noises - hid a mic in the bushes and mimicked alarm calls - the mothers freaked and the rest looked at the mothers. They understood the relatedness of themselves. 

Two females - female A does something rotten to female B, female B’s kid does something rotten to female A’s kid. All sorts of other species can do this. Evolution optimizes bh toward relatedness. Expend a lot of energy to convince others that your sibling is hot, and more of your genes are passed on. This explains a lot of animal behavior.


Reciprocal altruism - not all organisms compete - forgo competition at some points. Rock, paper, scissors scenarios. Equilibrium where no one group is harming another - all interdependent. Ex: 3 versions of bacteria - 1 generates a poison - 2 vulnerable to poison, but took up more food - 3 no poison, no energy spent making poison, so better able to find food. Each has strengths and vulnerabilities. 

Stalemates like this evolve - all competing, none acting for the good of the species. This isn’t exactly real competition. They’re not just stalemates, but cooperation. Even though the orgs aren’t relatives, altruistic behavior is expressed. Selfishness hurts in this situation. Cooperative hunters, synergistic relationships, etc. 

Rhesus monkeys given access to food, one circumstance monkeys can share food, another can just take food for himself: the sharer got more food back from the shared - cooperative behavior. 

Cooperation, even among relatives, has a strong payoff, with a condition: you’re not putting in more than you’re getting back - “reciprocal altruism.”

When would you see that? Smart, social animals - must remember stuff about individuals - must be long-lived so interactions can happen again - yet this is seen in bacteria and fungi. Two lines - one has dispersed widely, one narrowly - fruiting body vs stalk - see attempts at cheating - results in non-cooperation in social colonies. 

RA occurs in all sorts of systems. Intrinsic in RA is cheating, taking advantage of other individuals, detecting cheating against oneself. 

Ex: evolutionary psychology test - if you do this, you get this reward, if you do that, you get punished. Spontaneous acts of kindness and punishment - much better at detecting cheating if randomly punished rather than spontaneously rewarded. Optimal strategies must come about due to variability.

Some games have optimal strategies - researched in field called “game theory.” Optimal strategies exist for when to cooperate, when to cheat, when diplomacy works, when it doesn’t, etc. Many optimization models came about. 

Prisoner’s dilemma - two prison escapees are captured and interrogated. If both talk, they get punished, if one narcs the other off, one gets rewarded. This results in  4 possible outcomes with a formal payoff for each:
both cooperate - second-highest payoff
both cheat - second-worst payoff
A cooperates and B cheats - best payoff
B cooperates and A cheats - worst payoff

When is it optimal to cooperate or cheat? What you want to do is maximize your payoff. Humans are not rational - they decide based on this rule. If this type of scenario is played out in simulations in brain scans, the same brain behavior is seen with different actions - some light up at cooperation, some light up at cheating - big gender preference for one or the other.

How do you optimize prisoner dilemma play? in 1970’s, Robert Axelrod programmed simulation of how prisoner’s dilemma was played - wrote to colleagues and asked which strategies they would use - pitted every strategy against each other to find optimal solution. 

Out of it came one strategy that out-competed every other: tit-for-tat (T4T, t4t). Give what you get, but start off cooperating. If the other cheats, you cheat against them the next time. If they go back to cooperating, you do too. 

It is kind (starts with coop), retaliatory but forgiving, and clear-cut. Tit-for-tat drove other strategies into extinction. One weakness: retaliation in last round is disadvantageous - results in loss. You end up having to cheat on the last round if you’re cheated against in second-to-last. May lose some battles, but wins all the wars.

T4t has a weakness: doesn’t account for mistakes, noise/glitches,  or accidents - treats as cheating and thus cheats back (wrongly). If a mistake was made - if cooperation happened, but the receiving party got a signal of cheating, it doesn’t know about the cooperation and cheats wrongly in the next round. This perpetuates cycles of cheating. In simulation, US accidentally launched a missile at Russia due to a signal error - t4t response - USSR destroyed new york.

Another strategy mitigates this weakness: “forgiving t4t.” Exactly like t4t, but corrects for signal error - if cycle of cheating is entered, cooperates after a time irrespective of the others’ cheating - outcompetes t4t strategy. One vulnerability - can be exploited. If you’re playing against t4t, you’re going to keep cooperating against unforgiving opponents who keep cheating. 

Another even better strategy - start off with t4t - retaliatory, nice initially and amid cooperation - if and only if you’ve gone X number of rounds without being cheated on: switch over to forgiving t4t. This is called trusting somebody. If you get caught in a cycle of cheating, you forgive after X rounds and it goes back to mutual cooperation. 

Yet another: Pavlov - if you cheat, you get a bunch of points. If you cooperate, you get only some points. If both cheat, you lose some points. If taken advantage of, you lose a lot of points. Two outcomes you gain, two outcomes you lose. When I get a reward, I do it again, and if I lose, I cheat to regain points. Allows you to exploit someone who is forgiving - outcompetes t4t because of exploitation. 

Does this apply to real organisms? Paper published by Daniel Elsberg in 70’s - stole thousands of pages from the pentagon about Vietnam war - wrote one paper “Optimal benefits of perceived madness” talking about these optimization strategies. When do you fake insanity to entice cooperation from your opponents? Mutually-assured destruction doesn’t work - many people working on this problem.

Biologists started to look for these strategies in real animals - vampire bats don’t actually drink blood, they bring it home to their babies in a throat sac. Good example of RA: t4t strategy - cooperatively feeds each other’s babies. Distend the throat sac with air, and the other females will get jealous and not feed her babies because they think she’s being greedy (cheating). 

Stickleback fish do t4t: make fish believe he’s being attacked by another fish by putting a mirror against the tank - fish will attack it. Now put in a second mirror - he will think he has a cooperative partner. Make him think the other partner is cheating - angle the mirror downward - the original fish doesn’t attack, it’s t4t’ing against the other fish.

Some fish species change sex strategically. Black hamlet fish - pair of opposite genders hang out and swap genders - inequity - price of reproduction more for the female because male just has to give up some sperm and not carry the baby - reciprocal relationships. RA maximizes reproduction - if one fish stays male too much of the time, the other fish won’t mate with it. T4t strategy.

This isn’t nature being amazing, it’s nature simply following basic laws of statistics and logic.

Look a bit closer - the real world is rife with exceptions. Greg Packard looking at lions in east africa - prides are a bunch of relatives, sometimes not - RA going on - he put a speaker in the bush and played thousands of lion calls - one scared lion who habitually stays behind and doesn’t get punished. Why? Some explanations - maybe not that smart? Maybe interaction is more complex? Maybe another realm of behavior plays out in the background? Maybe he eats less of the meat and isn’t a burden? Not everything works perfectly.

Weird species - naked mole rat. Close to insects in how their colonies work. Live underground in Africa. Not necessarily relatives - one or two animals in colony not doing work - just sitting around. Bigger mole rats stuffing their faces with no punishment. Why? They play more important role - the big mole rats plug the tunnel entry points during rain. Those are the first to get eaten by predators.

James Holland - first person to get Computer Science PhD - got interested in game theory - designed ways to run these strategies - studied mutations in strategies and how often different mutations drove others into extinction. How does RA play out in natural selection? Cooperative hunting. Sexual selection? Make yourself and relatives desirable to mates - helps reproduction and copying of genes. 

One species - big ratio of male/female body size - another species - no discretion between size. What can we predict? Which ones feature more male aggression? First: bodies are built for it. 

How much reprod variability? One species all males have 1-2 kids - other 95% reprod is done by females. In which species does each couple have 1-2 kids? Second - fighting for reproductive access - more variability. What do females want? Big body size! Driving force for reprod. 

In one species, males don’t do anything with infants - second species, females want males who exhibit parental behavior, but same size as females. How do they find out males are competent parents? Doesn’t waste energy on muscles and promiscuity. Foragers demonstrate parental ability, looking attractive to females. 

Do you always want to give birth to twins? First - no, only one parent and two kids. Not enough energy to raise the kids. Second - yes, two parents can more easily take care of multiple children. Which species abandons kids? Second - in first species, males are gone anyway. First, bails if not enough energy spent on kids. 

First would be tournament species, second would be pair-bonding species. Contrast between the two. Big, bright plumage - tournament species. Healthy enough to be able to waste energy on courting. If the females are only getting genes from the males, might as well get good ones. Less variability, more streamlining of features. 

Opposite in pair-bonding species. Energy is spent on raising kids instead of courting females. This is how looking at skulls can tell you about a species. The same logic applies. Take male/female members of same species, compare size, habits, features, etc, and you can accurately deduce a lot about the social structure of the species.

Humans are in the middle between tournament / pair-bonding species. Both structures are expressed in different cultures. Some monogamous, some polygamous. Shortage of males can lead to polygamy. 
























Lecture 3 (Behavioral evolution 2):

NatGeo specials - “man is the only species that kills for pleasure” - wrong, we’re not the only species that kills - found by researchers in the 70’s. “babies are cute, they are protected by the species” - wrong, infanticide happens with several species. Langer monkeys - Sara Hurdey - lions - forced rethinking about this idea. Patterns to infanticide - tends to be adult males - not random - kills infants likely to be offspring of other males - cuts out competition. Why don’t we see this with any competitive social species? 

Only a certain pattern: average interbirth interval among females is longer than the avg tenure of a high-ranking male. Low-ranking male - works to be alpha - by the time he’s done, the females already have babies. So, it goes and kills the kids so it has a chance again. Takes over group so their sperm can be passed on.

Seen in Langer monkeys, mountain gorillas, lions, …

Mountain gorillas exhibit this trait, also very endangered. This is not behaving “for the good of the species.” What rules can we put to this pattern? Infanticide doesn’t happen when their siblings are procreating. 

Wild horses - new males harass females to the point of miscarrying - rodent species - new male shows up - smell of him causes fems to miscarry - olfactory signaling, releases stress hormone that causes abortion. Ovulates soon after. 

Male hamsters exhibit this behavior - unless close relative, new males cause abortions. 

Langer monkeys - don’t protect child at cost of own life, unless older female unlikely to have another child - maternal grandmother.

Another option: when pregnant, not after birth, new male comes in - commits pseudo-estrus (in heat, humans have signs of this, but don’t do it) so males mate with it - fall for it, and so aren’t infanticidal. Really muddies up the waters. Not a cognitive strategy - the animals don’t think through the logic of this, and so don’t generally see the ruse. Maybe not selected to do so.

Another example: studies of savanna baboons in 60’s - two males about to have a fight, and one low-ranking male holds baby hostage 

old thinking: “why would somebody attack someone holding a baby???” 

new thinking: after certain amount of observation, it’s clear that it’s not random which baby is grabbed - they’re grabbing kids likely to be the attacker’s relatives.

new male who just came in two weeks ago - likely hasn’t had a baby yet, so this strategy doesn’t work. Seen when this is used and the animal screws it up.

Aging male with kids around - new male comes - grabs his own kid, but throws him away if attacked to protect it.

Rank is inherited - daughter of alpha = high rank. Nepotistic rank hierarchy. 

About to get preggo - want to have male or female? Single or litter? Predominantly male or female? Choice comes down to: how much does it cost to have fem vs male? What are probabilities?

High degrees of variability in reprod success.

In tournament species: if you go for son - 90% of sons never reproduce - you get the 10% who reproduces and each of these fathers like 30 kids, going for males is a huge gamble. 

Going for females - each has about 1-5 kids, so female variability is down. Conservative strategy: have a daughter. Risky strategy: have a son.

What this predicts: 1. high-ranking females have more sons, low-ranking females have more daughters. Seen in a bunch of primate species. 2. When the going gets tough, goes for females over males - less calorically demanding - % of females goes up. Bias toward more females being born. 

Seen in humans - birthing a boy decreases body mass of offspring. If high-ranking, more worth having high-risk, high-payoff boys. If low-ranking, more worth birthing low-risk, low-payoff girls.Fluctuates around 50%. Robert Trivers, 50’s. 

Sometimes it’s appropriate to have more sons vs daughters - time is right. Suddenly, the minority becomes valuable - there’s less of them around. As a result, there are more of the more valuable sex being born, and the scales are tipped in the other direction again. Density-dependent selection. Oscillation around mean. Sex-ratio fluctuation.

Role of kinship: vervent monkeys: play infant alarm call - mother freaks out everyone else looks at mother. Another social structure in some species: polyandry - female mating with multiple males. Adelphic polyandry: two male lions sharing a pride occasionally when prides are normally headed by single male. Who are the two males? Two brothers. Kin selection. 
Seen in humans. Most cultures permit polygamy - example: rural Tibetan society exhibits adelphic polyandry. One woman marries a man, and all of his brothers. Why? Pattern seen in agriculturally impoverished areas - 5 sons - inherited land - need to remain one reprod unit, so don’t split up the land. Keeps farms from breaking up.

Intersexual competition: individ reprod interests vary between individ and their mate. Example: tournament species - males are migratory - mates with fem, has kids - guy leaves. No investment in reprod health of fem. Results in different reprod strategies. 

Example: in Mendelian genetics, normally it doesn’t matter who contributes which traits, but sometimes it does if the traits came from the mother or the father. “Imprinted genes” - found out in the 90’s - same mutations have different phenotypical manifestations depending on which parent it came from.

What mechanism makes the gene work differently depending on which parent it comes from? methylation. 

Why does this happen? David Hague - 90’s - look at imprinted genes - got from one parent, expressed. Got from other parent, silenced. Father-active genes are all genes that promote fetal growth and metabolism, thicker uterus, push for greater fetal dev. From female - slows down fetal dev. Intersexual competition plays out here. Migratory male hamsters - doesn’t care about reprod success of female, wants offspring to survive - male-imprinted genes assure this. Female does care about reproductive success, her genes counter this.

One gene from male comes in the form of insulin-like growth factor - makes fetuses grow more. Female has gene that codes for less responsive insulin-like growth factor receptors. Arms race between these ensues. 

Another pair of imprinted genes - father’s promotes placental invasion of fetus into uterine wall. Fem version slows this down. What if male’s gene is mutated? Only female’s gene is effective, fertilized eggs don’t implant. What if female’s genes is mutated? Only male gene is effective, and more aggressive fetal invasion ensues - results in choreocarcinoma - uterine cancer grows out of control. 

Some imprinted genes don’t work until after birth - work in brain - male derived makes infants suckle more (more calories) - female derived makes infants suckle less.

Male gene - expresses fetal enzyme fetal lactigen - makes it easier for fetus to draw sugar from mother’s milk (pregnancy hypoglycemia, diabetes) - female’s gene counters this - mother and offspring fight for calories, the offspring being driven by father’s gene.  

Problem? Pattern only seen in tournament species, not in pair-bonded species. No imprinted genes in pair-bonded species.

Humans once again in-between tournament and pair-bonded species.

Where does homosexuality fit in? A challenge for this thinking.

Another example: William Rice looking at fly species. Flies are polyandrous - fly mates and doesn’t want another fly to mate with her - she will have sperm from other males simultaneously - results in sperm competition. In flies, sperm makes toxins that kills other sperm - needs not to be toxic to oneself. Problem for females: toxins degrade female’s health. Rice took populations of flies and isolated the females so they couldn’t evolve - male competition ensued, and so males evolved and females didn’t. Over 30 gens, male sperm toxins were so toxic, they reduced life expectancy of females. Males don’t care, females die.

Rice flipped the script: isolated males and allowed the females to evolve - over 30 gens, gained defense mechanism that detoxified the sperm. Makes no sense under “good of the species” model. 

Another example: social primates - one gender hits puberty and moves groups to avoid inbreeding. Which gender disperses? no good rule found in primates for fem vs male exogamy, but variability exists. Females chimps leave, female gorillas leave, male baboons, maquaques, and others leave. 

Baboons - adult females grew up in group, adult males are from other group. Females have relatives, males don’t. Next door, fem chimps left, males stayed. Which species has higher levels of male aggression? Baboons, because they’re brothers. 

Which species has slaughtered humans in terms of warfare? Chimps. Males cooperate. Border patrols from males on edge of territory - kills foreign males. Jane Goodall - males kill another group and commit genocide on other groups - next-door males get along and look at first group - female exogamy. Humans in warfare - recruit unrelated members with “band of brothers” mentality. Female exogamy generally results in intergroup warfare.

How do we apply this?

Fourth branch: very controversial - group selection sneaks in -wildebeest - elderly wildebeest gets pushed in water and fed to crocs - only happens in special circumstances.

Marlin Perkins - mutual of Omaha’s “wild kingdom” - taught “good of species”

Two different versions of modern view of group selection: 
geographic event occurs to population, some of them isolated. Each go about reprod by different standards. Smaller pop more inbred. - Higher degree of relatedness. Kin selection - more cooperation in small group. More cooperation = higher payoff. Fixed trait of cooperation which is absent in bigger group. Smaller gets reintegrated into larger, and they’re so much more different now - large population gets nucleus of cooperative members from smaller group - reciprocal altruism - smaller outcompetes larger - spreads cooperation due to competition - founder effect - if advantageous trait evolves in smaller, that trait spreads into larger after reintegration. Transition from kin selection to RA. This is one way cooperation comes about in large pops. Human analogy: large city, one group of related people - make low-interest loans to each other - more business-successful - more economically successful. Spreads out to rest of city due to trust. Results in cooperation (“crystalization”). Jump-starts cooperation. T4t, forgiving t4t, Pavlov strategies all have to make a first move, and this is the first move to cooperation. In a system that doesn’t play by the rules, the first cooperative round is perpetually behind. Ways around this. This is one of them.
You have chickens with array of traits: 1 set is super-aggressive and beats on everyone else and lays lots of eggs, 2nd set is less aggressive and lays fewer eggs. Put two females together from both sets, and the high-aggression female will leave more copies of her genes. Now, group of females from both sets. High-aggro fems all injure each other. A dominates B, but groups of B dominate groups of A due to lack of infighting. This pushes toward group selection. Disadvantageous traits such as low aggression become advantageous in groups. If you indiscriminately make low-interest loans to everybody, you’re weaker. If you only make low-interest loans to each other, you outcompete everyone else. 

David Sloan Wilson “Darwin’s Cathedral” - birth of clusters of new religions over time - founders effect - analyzed start of Calvinism - a bunch of little religions popped up - this very effect contributed to popularity of Calvinism in Europe. 

Multi-level selection - sometimes selection occurs on the level of genes - decided entirely on one gene. Selection at group level, not individual level.

Edward Owen Wilson - Harvard - individual selection guy - Wilson and Wilson published a paper agreeing with each other - multi-lvl select and group sel both valid.

Where do humans fit into this? We’re in-between. 2 issues: 
Langer monkeys have infanticide, so do humans. May be an interesting model for how infanticide occurs in humans. Damsel flies commit rape, so do humans. 
These acts are inevitable based on evolutionary rules - a commonality, not an outcome. But humans have quirks. Blindly assuming these models apply to humans is problematic.

These models explain all of human behavior and biology in general. Social sciences will soon fall under exclusively biology.

Applications of this underlying logic bring about 3 pervasive features:
Heritability of traits. Kidnapping infants tendency, liking colorful plumage, etc.
Adaptiveness. Evolutionary demand for optimization has chiseled out these traits.
Gradual evolutionary change (not explicit). Change is played out over generations - butterfly effect.

Behavioral traits aren’t “genetic”, but have “genetic influences”, or “genetic influences based on environment.” Different fields say “genetic”, but this misses the mark - there are more explanatory models. Molecular fields rip this thinking to shreds.

Critics of adaptability call this “adaptational fallacy” - everything is there for an evolutionary reason (stripes, infanticidal tendencies). “Show me experimental evidence that this isn’t adaptive.” Some traits haven’t evolved because they are adaptive, they’re simply excess baggage. “Oh that’s just a more subtle feature of adaptability.” Squids can’t swim as well as other fish, but swim extremely well compared to their mollusk ancestors. The adaptiveness has to be in the context of where it came from.

Even factoring in hidden features of adaptation, that doesn’t necessarily say a trait is adaptive. 
Steven J Gould - Harvard paleontologist - teamed up with Richard Lieuwenten - lots of traits evolved because they’re spandrals (space between arches in a building - some trait that evolves as a result of some other trait having evolved). If everything has a purpose, so do spandrals. Not necessarily so, it’s just a result of the underlying logic. Some traits aren’t selected for, they’re simply a result of other traits. Humans have chins, other primates do not. So why did we evolve chins? There’s no way you can have a muzzle and a chin, the shape is wrong. Chins are spandrals. Evolution isn’t necessarily efficient - to be a squid, you have to start off as a mollusk. 

Andre LeWaffe - french microbiologist - evolution isn’t an inventor, it’s a tinkerer. It duct-tapes preexisting stuff together. It’s not about optimizing every trait. Competition isn’t necessarily competition, it’s just a way to pass on as many copies of your own genes as possible. 

Soviet evolutionary biologist - Western view is that most selection is a result of competition - running away from predators faster, etc. Evolving resistance to the elements. This would be an abiotic demand. Not a lot of competition - more survival. These soviet scientists held the view that selection is a result of having to adapt to climate extremes. 

Gradualism - if everything is adaptive, every slightly-better trait is adapted for, including competition. Gould et al challenged this view in the 80’s. Maybe evolution isn’t gradual, maybe nothing happens for a while - punctuated equilibrium. Subject of next lecture. The role of competition is less in this model.

Always been political critique of each of these models because it examines what is considered natural or not. Very different political critiques of different models in the field. Most of these critics were white, Southern males.

Isn’t it interesting that their notion of how evolution works predicts that they’re the ones that benefit most from traits being natural, such as rape being a human psychopathology or a competitive strategy, or children being more likely to be killed by stepfathers vs fathers, Huge political agenda assumed to be there.

Since the field emerged in the 70’s, there’s been a huge political agenda assumed within it. In one lecture in 1977, E O Wilson was knocked off the stage by people chanting “We live in a society of law and order.” Science for the People. All this sociobiological stuff is doing is supporting a male-dominated world rife with competition and aggression.

Counter to this is PE is exactly the world in which Gould or Lieuwenten would want it to be. Minimizing competition in favor of cooperation with stasis and rapid biological change. These views are dripping with sociopolitical underpinnings.
