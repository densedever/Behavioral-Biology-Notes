# Human Sexual Behavior

## Lecture 15 (Human Sexual Behavior 1):

rest of course now looking at various subjects: sex, aggression, competition, empathy, lang use, schizophrenia. Start off looking at what bh is thru ethologist's eyes.

will look at bh, what happened in the brain of the organism one millisec before the bh occurred? Which ntms were involved? And so forth. It’s stepping back thru the chain of progression to see what ultimately caused the brain to produce that bh (“acute releasing stimulus” [relstim]).

What hour/day/etc. did the events happening to the org start to produce that specific bh at that specific stimulus (meaning “at that specific time”)? Which horm sensitivities were present then that made some horms more/less effective or some env stimuli more/less noticeable? 

Will also talk about culture, perinatal effects, early dev, horms, the individ’s/pop’s/species’ genetics, and evolution of the org, and back and back. 

2nd half of course.

Alien joke.
“Why were they in such a rush at the end?”

acting on fervent desire to do good for the species
gene-passing optimization
“it feels good!”


Strange duality btw proximal / distal explanations of bh: 
“Why were they in such a rush at the end?”
(distal) Passing on copies of genes, etc. 
(proximal) Bc it feels good. 

Starting off, the thing to make sense of: sex bh is driven by loop of sensory stim, feedback, immediate sensations driving the bh coming out. Driving forces often very proximal.

Contrast btw two bh’s:
“All animals go about sex in similar way, but differently enough to separate them from other species.”
“All sorts of vertebrates have pelvic thrusting, orgasms, lordotic reflex, etc.” highly conserved FAPs across lots of diff species, passed down and chained together - FAP also need to be species-specific. FAP in one individ constitutes rel stim of FAP in another individ’s - also high amt of selectivity in species.

How does that selectivity begin to work?

Interplay btw relstim & FAP - chain of FAP’s are where species’ specificity comes from.

Professional sex jargon:
labido - sexual arousal, 3 most common terms:
Attractivity    - how attractive an individ is to others
Receptivity   - how receptive an individ is to others’ interest
Proceptivity  - bh carried out in response to being attracted to
dichotomy btw motivation and performance - men and erectile dysfunction - motiv/performance two diff things.

How to find info about sexuality? Many methods
Anonymous questionnaires - cleverer technique:
80s - joel coen, biological mathematician - invented clever technique to get ppl to divulge info about their adventures.

“What’s up w/ female orgasms?”

Fertility not dependent on them - can get preg w/out orgasm.
“Are we the only species that orgasms?” No. Monkeys, apes, etc. also have orgasms.
Some args that it increases fertility: 
Some evidence it facilitates sperm mobility by increasing vaginal secretion.
“It feels good”, so will desire sex, and will pass on more genes.
None of these have big enough effect to show results.

“Why clitoral orgasms?”

Might be a spandral. Simply baggage from evol history. Nipples are spandrals in men. Too much to get rid of.

“Which realms of sex bh are unique to humans?” Non-reproductive sex also seen in banobo monkeys, dolphins.

“How unique is homosexuality in nature?” Evidence that many other animals display homo bh. Mostly seen in captivity.

Humans have egalitarian sex. Endless striving for variety. Sex is private. Confusion btw sexual bh and violence. 

Masturbation also seen in many other organisms. Evidence that fantasies exist in other animals - baboons - sees hot female, gets erection, goes to masturbate.

Marriage present in all human cultures, even polygamous ones. ~90% of ppl married. Lot less sexual monogamy compared to social monogamy. # children raised by diff dad 10-40% in west europe. Majority of cultures throughout history poly, but majority of individs within those cultures mono.

Cheating and romance distinctly human, and are new concepts, only a few decades old in some countries.

Avg interbirth interval is 2-4 years - pt at which most marriages dissolve. Many humans “serial monogamists”, having one monogamous relationship after another corresponding to that interbirth interval.

Human sexual bh boring/limited compared with other species. Hermaphrodites - “why not have sex with oneself?” Incest avoidance. Some species change sex opportunistically - lots of fish species. Parthenogenesis - reprod w/out genetic input from a male. Bunch of snake species parthenogenetic, yet can’t reproduce w/out male input, even if they get no sperm.

Ready to make first big step: “What is going on in the brain?”

Involves lsys, but not just lsys. Determined by 30s/40s brain lesion studies concerning damage to lsys - with dmg comes change in sex bh. “Klüver-Bucy syndrome” - ex: monkey will mate w/ inanimate objects rather than other monkeys.

“What areas of lsys are relevant?”

Diff hotspots depending on gender. Among fems, one of the most important areas is ventrimedial hypothalamus (vmh), inv’d in fem sex bh. What’s the evidence? Lesion/stim/recording studies - destroy vmh, and fem exhibits no sex bh - stim vmh, and fem exhibits ovul bh. Vmh part of lsys that’s estrogen/progesterone hotspot. 

Another structure inv’d in horm aspects of female sex bh is midbrain. Lordosis reflex - spinal pathways that don’t exist in males - lordotic, “back-arching” reflex exclusively female.

Some parts of brain more inv’d in male sex bh than fem.

Part of hypo called “medial preoptic area” - lots of androgen/testosterone recepts. Amygdala (inv’s fear, anxiety, aggro, etc.) has big role in male sex bh. Inv’d with sexual motivation. Medial preoptic area more inv’d w/ male sexual performance, amygdala more about sexual motivation. May have to do with more males confusing sex with aggro.

Males have penises - erections - parasymp NS establishes erection, arousal inv’s transition from parasymp to symp NS - full symp needed for ejaculation. Same physiology underlying clitoral orgasms in fems. May be ex of spandrel not specific to male physiology.

Males, bc of erections, exhibit diff blood flow - dichotomy in species btw vascular/muscular erections - vascular: inc blood flow to penis to a dead end, “vascular engorgement” - muscular: in rodent species, “erector levii” muscle along with spinal cord neurons for pitching the tent. Vascular lasts longer, but muscular engages faster. Same physio process for each.

Might be same physio, but diff in recovery time btw sexes, how long it takes for symp to go back to baseline post-orgasm - fems have far slower recovery time.

Major neurobio finding: brain regions differ in size based on gender, including humans. “Sexual dimorphism” in brain - differing nuclei size, axon bundle/fiber size - got most attention: small cluster of nuclei in hypo called INAH cluster (interstitial nucleus of anterior hypothalamus) subset of nerve cell bodies that’s twice as big in males - somewhat reliable way of finding out someone’s gender - one exception.

Either some brain regions that are preferentially inv’d in, activated by sexual bh depending on gender, or regions w/ size diff depending on gender, but also many things in common with both genders - ex: orgasm physio exactly same. 

Big problem in males is too-rapid transition btw para/symp (“premature ejaculation”). 
Big problem in fems is failure to transition btw para/symp (failure to achieve orgasm). 
Pathologies or normal human variability? The debate rages.

More neurobio common btw sexes: “why are they in such a rush at the end?” neurobio of pleasure, reward, anticipation - in the world of dopamine. Role of dopamine identical and substantial in both sexes: ventral teg area sends dopaminergic projection to nucleus encumbens, which passes that on to lots of diff brain regions. 

Deplete this pathway of dop, and no interest in sex bh (“no labido proceptivity”). Classic circumstance: clinical depression - one of defining symptoms. Mesolimbic dopamine system - central to reinforcing aspects of sex bh. Not so much about reward, but anticipation of reward.

Also about fueling bh needed to reap reward - goal-directed bh - whole literature where humans aroused in brain scan - finding out which parts of brain most active in both sexes.

Seen in both sexes: activation of dopaminergic pathways - sex diff.

Guy is shown individ, if finds attractive, dop pathway doesn’t necessarily activate - if indiv making eye contact, activates, else doesn’t. When shown unattractive women, activates when looking away. Also seen in gays when looking at attractive same-sex individs. Sex orientation trivial in its influ of neurobio of sex bh.

When looking at dop rising in anticip rather than reward - 2000 study - monkey in room, light goes on (session is starting), if it presses levers adequately, gets reward - dop lvl doesn’t go up after reward, but on anticip of reward (“getting pumped” for an activity - goal-directed bh). 

Switch it up to where monkey only gets reward half the time, what happens to dop lvls? They shoot up tremendously - biggest dop lvl rise apart from cocaine! Introduce “maybe” into test, and you’ll get tons of motiv bh. Will work harder for a “maybe” than for a certainty (“intermittent reinforcement”).

Expanded the test: now only get reward 25% or 75% of the time. Some getting more/less reward, but what this has in common is both situations carry smaller “maybes” than the 100% chance circumstance - results in rise of dop lvls, but lesser rise than 50%, where lvls peak.

Social engineers can convince ppl of 50% when there’s not (casinos, etc.) - results in goal-driven bh. “a relationship is the price you pay for the anticip of it.”

One final, pertinent piece of dop sys is there are many diff dop recept subtypes. Two important in sex bh / reward: D1 and D2 dop recepts. In monogamous species, after mating, after pair-bond first formed, D2 recept lvls immediately downreg’d, D1 upreg’d. 

Why? Drive down D2 lvls before they mate, no pair bond formed.
Prevent D2 decline after mate/pair bond, will quickly pair-bond w/ another org. D2 seems to mediate rewarding/anticipatory aspects of pair bonding, while D1 seems to mediate pleasure of mono features of pair-bond.

Brain image study - put ppl in 2 categories: both categories have “found their beloved”, one category knew their soulmate for like 2 weeks, other known for more than 5 years. Subliminally flashed them pics of ppl they know (this is a control in the study) interspersed w/ pics of their beloved. 

Dop sys goes nuts in the ppl who’ve known their soulmate for only like 2 weeks. Do the same w/ that same relationship 5 years later, and dop sys doesn’t activate, instead anterior cingulate activates (inv’d w/ empathy, comfort) - can see neurochemical transition btw having raging love inferno for beloved and regarding them as just a warm, soft, comfy armchair.

Rodent studies - must have high lvl of D2 recepts for pair bond to form. Being faithful requires low-D2 / high-D1 lvls.

D2 about formation of attachment, D1 about maintaining attachment.

55:00

Much to do about frontal cortex (bh reg, impulse control, gratification) - appropriates sexual bh / context. If damaged, you bh very sexually inappropriately. Martinez, East Bay - old man had stroke dmg to frontal cortex - raped woman in nursing home.

Frontal cortex also gets you to do proceptive sexual bh - ex: you’re courting female, being challenged, frontal cortex gets you to do those bh’s despite the dangerous situation.

Frontal cortex reigns in bh, doesn’t change underlying FAP’s, only the context in which they occur.

Now looking at another part of neurobio: “When having sex, which horms are triggered? What is the hormonal response of sexual bh?”

In both non-/human females, having sex increases rel of progesterone-derived horms, has to do with reinforcing pleasure. In fems, also incs lvls of testosterone-derived horms in blood (androgens). Fems generate maybe 5% the androgen males do thru adrenal glands - seem to play central role in mediating female sexual motiv / arousal. 

How do we know? In fems w/ adrenal glands removed, no sexual arousal. Give them androgen, and their sexual proceptivity returns. 

Oxytocin also very important. Works as ntm - central role in forming of attachments, pair bonds. Fem humans, when having sex, rels lots of oxytocin. Introduce oxy into brain, ppl become more trusting. Spritz oxy up someone’s nose, their trust lvls skyrocket. May be used in marketing.

What is oxytocin doing in the body? It doesn’t just sit in hypo, vast majority from posterior pituitary - oxy has to do w/ nursing, milk letdown - plays role in sexual pair bonding - monogamous sexual attachment descendent of mother-offspring attachment.

At the male end of things, during sex, test lvls rise during sex - the more sexual bh, the higher test lvls - lvls raise in response to sex, not during it.

Vasopressin is to males as oxy is to fems. Vaso also found in NS - critical in forming pair bonds. In mono, has expr of vaso recept gene on neurons that rel dop. Males sec vaso, and if you’re a species where vaso stims dop neurons, decide you like fucking this other org, and come back for more - take poly voles - male vole, stick vaso recepts into dop neurons, poly becomes mono. 

Look at mono species where males have vaso recepts on dop neurons, individs w/ more recepts there form pair bonds faster.

What about primates?

Two diff species: pair bonding marmosets, poly rhesus monkeys - mono has vaso recept gene variant, mono variant in mono monkeys. Differing amts of vaso recepts in dop pathway decide mono vs poly in most cases. More of them, and pair bond formed faster. Diff lvls found in mono vs poly rodents and monkeys.

What about humans?

Among apes, both variants of vaso recept genes found in dop pathways. Chimps have poly version, they’re very poly. Banobos have mono variant, yet are majorly poly, maybe most poly in world. More complicated than # of vaso recepts in dop pathway.

Humans again lie in the in-between world. We have both variants of the vaso recept genes. Some ppl have mono, some have poly, but still somewhere in-between. Being in-between recurring theme? Humans have versions of these genes w/ slight variations bc of genetic variation.

Two independent studies: have mono version of vaso recept gene, more likely to get/remain happily married.

Large body of studies showed mutations in variations of vaso recept gene in autistic families - very little attachment to other humans.

Everything in neurobio thus far focused on heterosexual relationships, so what is the neurobio of sexual orientation?

Landmark study - inah nucleus - men’s twice the size in humans and 
simon leveigh - neuroanatomist - looked post-mortem inside ppl’s brains, and found that the inah was half its size in gay men, the size of hetero women. Primary patients were gay men who died of AIDS.

Another diff in hypo based on sex orientation, found on avg bigger in men, bigger in straight men. Called the “sexual dimorphism of the hypothalamus.”

What other diff are there based on sex orientation? finger ratios similar to that of same sex; autoacoustic reflex (low sound heard when plugging your ears) - vibrations higher pitch in fems and gay men vs straight men. Probably perinatal horm effect.

Quite sparse literature on gay women, but findings have been that 4th-2nd finger length ratios and autoacoustic vibrations like that of straight men.

Final realm of neurobio: neurobio of transsexuality - used to be considered psychopathology. DSM considered it a disease - reversed later on.

Another sex difference in avg size: bed nucleus of the stria terminalis - where amyg sends projections to hypo - reliably twice the amt of neurons in males. Study showed reliably that transsexuals had size of this part consistent w/ which sex they insisted they were. 

Maybe bc horm treatments during sex change op? No, ruled out - same effect in those w/out op. Had to do w/ insistence they got the wrong body rather than horms.

Additional study on trans ppl: ~60% of ppl w/ penile cancer who got amputation got “phantom penis” sensations. Didn’t happen in m2f post-op trans ppl. Completely novel area of research.

Next bucket: What in the env rels sexual FAPs? What are sensory triggers?

Jump into ethology-land: diff bh in diff species. Sometimes all visual (turkeys - think back to dummy turkeys confusing real turkeys). Other species such as primates also visual. Rhesus monkeys - press lever, get reward, or see high-ranking male. Presses lever most to fems in heat. Humans mostly visual - more responsive to visual stim than other stim, men more so than women - more activ of dop pathways and amyg (aggro) than women.

Tactile stim - stim right recepts, sexual arousal. Some types of tactile recepts in some body parts activate dop more than others - “erogenous zones” - recepts resp to stim change w/ horm lvls. 

In women, tactile stim evokes more dop activ when ovulating. In men, requires testosterone. When castrated, no testosterone, no sexual arousal. In women, lordotic reflex - exclusively women - requires high estrogen.

Coolest sensory modality for sexual relstim - olfaction, pharamonal comm/sexual arousal.

sar = sexually arousing/sexual arousal
sph = sexually arousing pharomones
ph = pharamone/s

Gen of sph - required in both sexes: right horms. Males don’t gen sph if they lack testosterone lvls - women w/ ovaries removed don’t produce sph.

What are chemical constituents of spharomones? Fatty acids, breakdown products of sph androgen/estrogen. Makes up part of arousing aspects of sph. Olfactory organs have lots of recepts for these sph.

What doesn’t make sense is perfume - made out of sweat of *male* animals - musk. Synthetic perfumes made of synthetic androgen breakdown products. Why made of male musk if males are whom you’re trying to attract? Perfumes mostly purchased by women (maybe so that women buy them, and not because they actually work?)

What sort of info is carried by pharamones? Used for olfactory comm btw genders - will tell you species, gender, whether castrated, healthy, related to you, terrified or not - will have more gluco breakdown products in it.

Need to have horms intact to gen ph, but also the right reprod horms to perceive them, too. If fem and no estro, or if male and no testosterone, can’t distinguish sweat btw male/fem, but gonadally-intact orgs can. Horm replacement takes care of these problems.

Women better at telling genders apart when ovul. Not seen in gay ppl - they sense the sph of own gender better.

Human Sexual Behavior 2

Lecture 16 (Human Sexual Behavior 2):

Women better at differentiating smell of men vs women and gonadally-intact vs non, and also better at doing this around point of ovul. Women’s preference for male smell gets more dramatic around pt of ovul.

Landmark study: women had their pits swabbed at diff pts in menstrual cycle - males smelled the swabs and rated them by pleasantness. Rated least unpleasant around time of ovul. Testosterone-dependent phenomenon.

Now looking at physiological effects of sph within/btw sexes.
 
Wellesley effect - sync menstrual cycles - done w/ pharamones. Shown in rodents: pharamones of adult fem delays puberty onset of young fems - reprod competition - leaves more copies.

Intramale physio effects - depends on rank of who you’re smelling. In primates and some rodents, males able to tell high-ranking from low-ranking individs. What you see: when low smells high, drives down testo lvls - great competitive strategy for those who can pump out right suppressant phars. In other species, you see inc in sperm count - counter-strategy. If males gen ph that drive down opponent’s testo lvls, sensory mech needs to evolve to counter that by inc sperm production. 

Interaction of phars btw the sexes:

Physiologically, when fem donates phars to other fem, decreases puberty onset. If male to male, drives down testo, sometimes drives up sperm prod.

Seen in lots of rodent species btw genders: when male is donor for sphs, accelerates puberty onset in fems, when fem donates to male, drives up testo lvl and sperm prod.

7:30

Some species such as pigs have their ovul cycles induced from sensory stim such as pharomones: induced ovulation.

Anon author of scientific paper published in Science 30 yrs ago showed diff in beard growth based on testo lvls, which were changed by interaction w/ a fem.

If fem donates sph to other fem, results in dec ovul and delayed pub onset. Less of an effect if these two fems are siblings.

In gay men, men’s smell preferred, comes with high testo lvls.

Women prefer smell of men when ovul, and noses become more sensitive to man smell due to olfactory recepts for estrogen.

Gustatory stimuli - “phlegming” - giraffe - want reprod info on s/one else, lick their privates and get the info.

tovul = time of/around ovulation

Some stimulants for ovul are auditory - MN stags roar and induce ovul in females. Human fems’ voices get higher around time of ovul.

Humans’ sensory releasers: most erogenous organ is brain: not great at getting stimulated through sound.

repbh = reproductive bh
sbh = sexual bh

Both fear and rage bring down libido. Stress is interesting: chronic stress is suppressive of reprod physio & bh. Acute stress has lot of variability, sometimes stims or inhibits. War has had history of gruesome sexual activities happening.

Coolidge effect: multispecies - when sexually sated, proximity to another fem restarts male’s libido. Turns out that variety really is the spice of life.

What goes on with horms in the long term?

repcyc = reproductive cycle

How much is fem sbh a function of where in repcyc you are? World of species where proceptivity only seen near/during tovul. Non-human primates have looser relationship. Where do humans fit? 

Classic study - early 70’s - human women reported sexual activity, lvl of libido, likelihood of orgasm, stage of repcyc, etc. - found that their lvls had spiked during days 14 and 28.

No other species shows inc around day 28. Why? Women are less fearful of pregnancy around time of period, and thus sbh inc. Highest amt of sbh when high estrogen lvls. Freq difficult to replicate this data, but clear that arousal incs during tovul. 

Shows that bh doesn't tell as much as motiv, arousal, or proceptivity at that time. Interesting lit  saying women act diff around tovul such as wearing provocative clothing. 

Jeffery Miller - evol psych, U of new mexico - reported that at tovul, lapdancers get larger tips.

As estro lvls inc, so does expr of progesterone recepts (inv'd w/ sexual pleasure). 

Higher estro lvls also lead to inc synth of oxytocin - women feel more affiliative w/ prev sexual partners. Estro also has physio effects - lowered threshold for tactile sensitivity - also lowers thresholds for detecting male smells. Andros play role in proceptivity, inc libido and motiv.

Meanwhile, males + testo - what has to do w/ sbh in males? Lots: correlative evidence - time of year where males mate is when testo lvls highest. Over lifespan, testo lvls greatest early on, gradually waning with age.

Studies show that more sexually active men tend to have higher testo lvls. Paternity shown to result in dec testo lvls and inc vaso lvls.

Is this a correlation or a causation? We already know sexual activity inc testo lvls, so this also explains the correlation, cutting out testo as a causative factor altogether.

Does testo inc sbh lvls? Yes. How do we know? Get rid of testo by castration, and lvls of sbh and motiv drop dramatically - from lever-pressing to courtship displays, etc. How to test this? Artificially restore testo to normal lvls w/ horm therapy - sbh returns. 

But does this prove causation? Not necessarily. If testo lvls are zero, lvls of sbh aren't zero, no matter which species studied. How much residual sbh there is after castration depends on lvl of sexual exp beforehand. It's got nothing to do with the horms.

Male castrated - instead of artificially restoring horm lvls to 100%, raise it to 10% instead, or 200%, and see what happens. You see full restoration of sbh when inc of lvls ~normal physio range. The brain regions inv'd in sexual motiv require testo to work fully - not so much concerned w/ lvls, but presence of the horm. Bh drives testo lvls, testo lvls don't drive sbh.

One exception: 10x increase in testo lvls - supraphysiological - out of normal range of bodily production. Ex: abusing anabolic steroids, results in inc of proceptive sbh.

What does test have to do w aggro? Doesn't play causative role, but modulatory - sensitizes you toward stimuli evocative of sexual arousal - lowers the threshold. It doesn't cause the sbh, it facilitates it.

Melatonin - tells the body what time of year it is - sensitive to amount of light over seasons, years. Used for seasonal mating - whole pathway in brain - triggers seasonal mating. Do humans have seasonal mating patterns? A bit of evidence supports this.

Now looking at perinatal development. Focusing on early env factors having to do with adult sbh, what does early childhood have to do with sbh?

Another concept: very little about early life that influences quality of going about sex - indicates FAP - shown in species after species - learn social conventions around sex, appropriate context, etc. Lit emerging in 1950's, looking at captive primates - what are conseq of growing up in social isolation in terms of bh? 

Raised in different lvls of social interaction: grows up w/ mother, w/ peers, w/ peers & no mother, w/ neither peers nor mother, etc. What results is perfectly normal sbh on inappropriate partners at inappropriate times.

Kabbutz lit: if you spend a lot of time w/ someone before age 6, you don't want to act proceptively toward that person - they feel like a sibling ("pseudo-kin").

What does early experience have to do with sexual orientation? 2 broad models describing how boys became gay as adults:
absence of father figure. What do fathers contribute? Appropriate contexts for sbh.
screwed-up mother. Makes you crazy growing up - one of those disorders being homosexuality.
Neither model has evidence to support it.

What is going on with horms during this time period?

pn = perinatal
pnp = pn period
pne = perinatal effect/s
hlvls = horm lvls

so = sexual orientiation

What pn hlvls have to do w/ adult sbh - depends on species. 
Rodents - everything. Humans - more evidence needed.

Dichotomy in endo: "organizational effect" in pnp - how do hlvls influence how brain devs? What are horms doing? Horms are "activational" rather than "organizational" after postnatal dev. Not really as clear-cut as this.

In rodent species, pn exposure has massive effects. Male rodents, if not exposed to testo pn'ally, will have diff rodent's sor later on. Huge lit shows that sor is on a continuum - 300 species documented to have homo bh.

In non-human primates: expose fem monkey fetus to supraphysio testo lvls - masculinizes the brain. How does that show up in adulthood? If nothing else, no effect. Otherwise, inject her with androgen, gets male faps. if->then clause: if masculinization, then testo has activational effect on sbh.

Prenatal:     - + - +
Postnatal:     - - + +
FAPs:         - - - +

When abusing steroids, supra-range, does body downreg testo recepts? Yes, but not enough.

What pn androgenizational effects do we see in human fems? Used to know answer.

When are circumstances where human fems will get heavily andro'd? 2 circumstances:
congenital adrenal hyperphasia - adrenal glands pump out too much andro.
diethylstilbesterol (DES) - drug that dec'd miscarriage likelihood - some women's biochem such that the des converted to androgens - babies became andro'd.

What are they like afterward? Expectation: masculinizing effects on bh. Diffs in bh shown during adolescence, including higher likelihood of becoming lesbian. Problem: confound - if pn andro'd, born w/ weird genitals - fixed with massive plastic surgery. Not merely change in hlvls.

Another feature of early exp: what does pnenv have to do w/ sexual identification? Could be dictated by horms, but not enough to determine it. Also seen: born intersexual - far from clear which med decision to make in terms of assignment success

Most irritating thing about steroid horm effects in brain: testo - binds to testo recepts and does its thing - 1950's research done showing:
in some parts of body, testo works/binds normally
in other parts, testo turns to dihydrotesto - works a bit diff, but not much
some of testos actions done by being converted to estrogen, which binds to estrogen recepts causing typical male bh!
Once testo enters a target cell, turned to estrogen. No effect on circulating testo lvls, only happens in cells equipped to do the conv. No diff in lvls, but diff effects on body.

Testo exerts its effects on brain by conv to estrogen - exerts effects on genitals/sensitive skin by conv to DHT.

2 things should come to mind:
pn testo lvls going about normal effects - part of it on how brain organizes. Pn mascul req's testo to be conv'd to estro. Why don't all fems get andro'd then? Not always getting estro from ovaries, but from mother, too. Alpha-fetoprotein occurs in circulation during preg - binds estro, degrades it, results in fetal estro never having bodily effects, neither from mother, nor fetus. 

The only fetuses that have estro in their neurons are males whose testo got conv'd. As a result, you don't get the organizational feminizing efects of horms pn'ally - where does the brain feminization come from? Old answer: female brain is default; must actively masculinize brain. Really, other horms responsible for feminization.
testicular feminization syndrome - phenotypically female who doesn't reach puberty because she is actually male w/ undescended testes - mutation in testo recepts, rendering testo ineffective. 
No testo signals mean no signaling mediated by testo or DHT, but perfect masculinization of the brain via estro. TFM's nevertheless have masculinizational effects in brain, but social cuing results in one certain gender identity.


What does genetic makeup have to do w/ sbh? Lots. 
Genes determine which gonads you dev, and thus which horms your body secretes, and thus which genitals you have... Can be blunted by env (TFS).

Genes play role in sex determination. 

What is known of genes and sor? Lit shows certain genetic heritability of sor. Twin studies: monozyg twins - 1 twin is gay, other twin has 50% heritability of that sor, dizyg 22%, normal siblings 9%. More genes in common, or more pnenv in common, the greater the likelihood of sharing of sor. Could be many probs with that interp.

Reporing of 1st genetic markers for sor - Dean Hammer - geneticist, NIH - gene locs more likely to be shared between gay siblings (both were gay) vs non-gay siblings. Newspapers off and running with "Scientists Have Discovered the Gay Gene!" Obviously false. No consistency in study in terms of gmarks - each marker showed up in different parts of genome. Has not been replicated.

Final leap: if talking about genes, you're also talking about the evolutionary history bringing about those genes, which proteins those genes code for, early env that changes epigenetic state of gene transcription, etc. So what does evolutionary biology tell us about sbh?

1st: orgs have sex for good of species.
2nd: maximizing copies of genes, sbh about reprod. Only have sbh around tovul.

Non-reprod sex is a wrench in the engine of this idea. Humans have non-reprod sex, but many other species besides humans do too - ex: banobo chimps ("pigmy chimps").

Jane Goodall chimps: tournam, extremely high aggro, build weapons, have wars. Only find banobos in one place in congo basin - reprod'lly isolated w/ rest of chimps. Banobos have little sexual dimorphism, fem dominance, lots of sex.

A species w/ low aggro and little sexual dimorphism in body size - indicator of pair-bonding species, yet banobos have astonishing amounts of sex, even while not ovulating, with same sex, and in ways that couldn't result in pregnancy.

Joan Roughgarden, ecologist, Stanford bio dept - many species exhibit far more non-reprod sex, indicating sex-for-reproduction not evolutionarily selected for.

In chimps and other primates, grooming each other very good social glue, and sbh in banobos seems to play similar role.

This goes against a dominant view in last century: Sir Sali Zuckerman - sbh purely for group cohesion and decreasing violence. Sbh actually cause of majority of aggro in lots of species.

What else does evol say about sbh? One critical issue: what is the cost of reproducing? Sperm doesn't cost a lot, but eggs, perinatal care, etc. does. Fems more selective than males about who they mate with. Exception: pair-bonding species. 

Ex: marmosets - male does as much childcare as fems, always have twins. Around time offspring born, fem has put in work and gone thru preg, and father now carries kids around, etc. Males, in long run, expend more calories taking care of kids than females - results in cuckoldry. Fems might pick up and abandon father - found in bird species. Exception to rule that males don't expend much when contributing to reproduction.

See not only fem pickiness, but male attempts to control fem reprod ability/bh. Ranges from primates in consortships, "mate-gaurding" (protecting fem from other males), to many other things, including in humans: clitorectomies, chastity belts, and other more complex social rituals. 

Happens in groups where the males disappear for long periods such as nomadic pastoralists - animals spending time at the better grazing areas, Crusader going to protect Jerusalem from the Ottomans, etc. These decrease sexual pleasure and make fem less likely to have sex.

Also explains what was thought to be dom models of reprod bh - "linear access model" - ex: baboon social group - group only has one fem in estrus, who mates with her? #1 in the group. If two fems in estrus, who mates with them? #1 and #2 in social hierarchy... implies lack of fem choice. Male dom rank completely predictive of reprod success. Not always as clear as this.

Other forms of male-male competition to control fem reprod bh: copulatory plugs (in canine species) - barbed penises, sperm competition, reduction in effectiveness of next male's sperm, chemical reduction in ability to give off sex horms - decs fem sexual proceptivity in some fly species. 

What about fems? Also fem-male competition - fems develop counter-strategies - "hidden ovulation" present in humans - decreases paternity certainty. Humans not very aware of which stage of ovul others are in. Gives fems more choice in reprod. Pseudo-estrus another way of tricking males and giving fems more reprod freedom.

Male-male competition: most common is comp for reprod access. Explains how all social species' main cause of aggro is access to fems. Is the case in every human culture. 

Where do humans fit on this? Poly species put out lots of sperm, thus they have larger testes. Mono species have little sperm comp, thus smaller testes. Chimps have large testes per body size, gorillas don't. Humans in-between when compared w/ other primates.

Evolutionary aspects of fem-fem comp: fems have no choice - linear access model dominant from 60's to 80's - no evidence. Shocking concept in primatology: degree of female choice - violated all previous models. How does that occur in tournament species? Fems physically weaker, so must compensate. One strategy is tiring out the male - baboons repeatedly lead male to his rival to start a fight and fuck the winner ("stolen copulation").

Who do fem baboons want to mate with? Like to mate with male baboons who are nice to them - groom them, play with their kids, don't take out aggro on them, etc. 

Barbara Smut - primatologist, U of Michigan - mid 80's - primates have intersexual friendships ("just friends") - another source of stolen copulation, resulting from manipulative bh - nice guy farce a male counter-strategy to fem cleverness. 

Problem: you're a fem baboon who wants to mate with a nice guy - nice to your 3-4 yr old kid, likely father w/ kid - but if likely father, was higher-ranking male 3-4 yrs ago, so no longer viable father compared with healthier males. Results in more stolen copulations.

Other alt strategies: male sbh not from male-male comp, but from alt strategy - old thinking: ex: orangutans - great apes with bizarre social systems - lots of low-ranking males who don't mate. New thinking: 70's, Peru de Gaul de Cause, researcher - noticed low-ranking males with lesser chance of mating tend to rape fems.

Many fish species whose low-ranking males pretend to be fem, adopt fem coloring, etc, and get close with fem so they can steal a copulation.

Much different world than the mechanical world of cost-benefit trade-offs of energy loss through sperm vs through pregnancy.
