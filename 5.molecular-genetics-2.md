# Lecture 5 (Molecular genetics 2):

Mutations in splicing factors result in synthesis of entirely new proteins, driven by the outside influences.

Do these have functions? Not very often. More to come.

Splicing enzymes have their own genes, so there is a whole huge recursive process here.

Big consequences come from promoter mutations - different transcription factors

Promoters have multiple copies down the line - change promoter version, change network. Makes new if->then clause leading to novel effects. This sets up for macroevolutionary change.

GP/gp - “gene and promoter gene”

Vole - promoter upstream of gene of vasopressin - has to do with social affiliative nature of males - has a receptor with its own gene with its own receptors. Many vole species - some mono/polygamists. Difference with monos - different promoter upstream of vasoreceptor gene than the polys. Change the promoter, change mono to poly. Change promoter, change pattern of gene expression without changing genes, but gene promoters

dinorphine - has gene - upstream promo - # copies in rats affect addiction levels.

Vasopressin gp - if human male, which version Vgp affects relationship stability - more likely to get divorced. No diff in gene, but promo.

Next domain for getting macro change: gene for transcription factor - completely different networks. Human vs Chimp genome - 98% same DNA - what are the differences?

Disproportionate share of genetic differences in genes for transcription factors. Change in TF = new networks.

80’s - King, Wilson - Berkeley - came up with 98% number - predicted most interesting evol changes occur in regulatory parts of DNA. Turn ancestor of us and chimps into completely diff-looking things - result of change in regDNA (promoters, supressors, transcription factors, etc.).

From that comes endless networks where small changes are amplified way out of proportion. 

Hunter Fraiser - Stanford - studying how much evchange occurs from regDNA mutations.

Changing genes/proteins might not have much of an effect, but changing if->then clauses definitely gums up the works for a long time.

100 species’ genomes sequenced - sizes ranging widely - more genes = more % of DNA is transcription factors.

If only 1 gene, only 1 TF.
If two genes, 3 TFs: mapping to every combination of those two: A, B, AB
If n genes, 2^(n-1) TFs. 

Dramatic increase in TFs needed for generating networks of gene expression.

Tiny changes in regDNA = big consequences.

Microevolution - involves functions of proteins
Macroevolution - involves which proteins, networks, if->then clauses

Highly revolutionary model about macroev - drawn from Barbara McClintock - extremely successful plant geneticist and NASci member - career destroyed by discovery - worked with corn - different color kernels - bios didn’t know about genes, but did know about trait inheritance.

Sees inheritance pattern - concludes changes caused from mobile genes - transposable genes - transposons - considered crazy by peers, shut herself away with her experiments for decades and wrote papers.

80’s - knowledge of DNA and genes showed she was right. Bios lost their shit.

Gave her the Nobel prize at ~80 yrs old. Continued until she died in 90’s.

She wasn’t that crazy, wasn’t that ostracized, just couldn’t write well - papers incomprehensible.

Field matured - found that McClintock picked right species: plants.

You’re an animal: can run in tough situations. Plants can’t - need protection - stress responses.

Ex: Move genes around in DNA in attempt to protect themselves in challenge. Transposase - enzymes tend to end in -ase: lactase, sucrase, transposase - plant defense. Copies gene, shuffles it somewhere else, and hopes for the best.

Scientists explored this with animals - found transposons in them, too.

Scientists invent novel pathogen, injects into people, makes them sick. Antibodies are developed against it - how so various in making antibodies? Splicing and shuffling of antibody genes, hoping to make bazillions of new networks - basically brute-forcing it and filtering out the nonworking/inferior combinations.

Not the only ones doing that - pathogens do the same. Trapanazome parasite - body generates antibodies - pathogen sheds surface proteins and shuffles DNA for a novel version of it - body has to restart antibody generation

Always a step ahead, meaning immune sys has to evolve better antibody generation methods. Arms race ensues - eventually making transposons.

Occurs outside immune sys, and under special conds

Special transpositional elem - predom in primates - certain cell type/time of life where most mobile: brain cells making new neurons/progenitor cells when they start spreading. 

Increase mvmt of elem at that time - making new neurons - DNA is shuffled to get novel neuronal growth/function. Esp important in early dev - shuffling most active at this stage. The cells making you ‘you’ are the least constrained by genetic determinism - shuffling more active than in any other bodily cell.

Variability from transposable events naturally makes good things and bad - mostly bad. So, finally, are these disasterous? Maybe.

Shuffling is random, so order/usefulness of networks is unlikely, but shuffling helps the process along. It also has big macroev consequences.

Ex: if->then (promoter->gene) clause - you’re dehyd - hematocrit - if dehyd -> then tell kidneys to retain water - not this simple.

Kidneys listen to network signals, not single sets of genes. Suppose some trans event - moves genes - gets put upstream from the genes telling you to ovulate - activates those genes. 

Results in more frequent ovulation depending on threshold - about to die of dehydration, ovulate in last effort to pass genes on? Most used for seasonal mating - wet/dry seasons - ovulates when near water, so gives birth during rainy season.

Ex: crude - have if->then + promoter - tells me that some person smells like me. Turns off transcription of fertility-relating networks - assumes that similar smell = similar genes. Anti-incest is a nature-wide trend.

Transp event - put if-smells-like-me->then network upstream of cooperation gene. Start of kin selection - if more promoters: if-really-smells-like-me->then, and other networks are introduced, giving rise to levels of degree of stimulation, etc. Fine-tunes genetic code. This idea is ridiculous and too simplified, doesn’t relate to the real world, but is a rough approx of the idea.

No one promoter for smells-like-me. instead, that’s a result of an interaction of many networks in response to the outside stimulus.

Transp evs don’t just move around regDNA, but parts of genes via exons. This makes novel genes.

Steroid hormones - glutocorticoids, andro/estrogen, progesterone work like this:
Horm binds to receptor cell, lock-and-key - steroids aren’t made of amino acids, but still has unique shape with uniquely-shaped receptors.

When received, a signal is sent which recognizes specific promoter in DNA - estrogen-responsive promoter. There’s one part of the receptor that recognizes the horm (hormone-binding domain), another that recogs the promoter itself (DNA-binding domain). 

Suppose a transposable evt comes along, and the horm-binding domain gets clipped off and replaced with another HBD - this makes new if->then clause.  

Ex: glucocorticoids - these suppress immune sys - “steroidal anti-inflams.” Non-steroidal has fewer side-effects. 

Bind to glucocortical receptors and bind to glucocortical-responsive promoters. 

Then, pluck out the gluco receptor and replace with progesterone receptor, and you have a novel receptor. Now, instead of suppressing immunity when glucocorticoids are received, suppress progest recepts instead. This suppresses immsys during preggo so your body doesn’t eat your baby. Creates distinction between baby and foreign matter.

Has a catch, though. When pregnant and stop being immsupp. Immsys is tired out, and if becomes too active, leads to auto-imm disease. Bad for people with lupus, they are recommended not to get preg.

Sometimes genes or stretches of genes duplicate - “copy # variant” - copying of stretches of genes leads to complex results, including one gene being a backup if the other is mutated.

# of copies changes how many proteins you can make. Japanese tend to have more copies than Westerners of genes relating to carb digestion. Even copies of genes can make a difference.

More copies means more there to experiment with, and can result in “faster” evolution. One gene is already doing the work, leaving the other to shuffle around.

Joe Thornton - U of Oregon - worked on steroid recepts - showed this occurs in ancestral genes

This explains away Creationist notion of “irred compl” Rapid transition not needed if the shuffling genes fall into the right place to make receptors able to create novel protein structures. The complex systems are made piecewise, with the pieces falling into place when the right shuffling happens.

Russel Fenol (Sanford) - researched eye evol - showed you can have half an eye in many diff forms.

Messing around with one base pair messes up the network attached to it, and changes the proteins made by a bunch of different genes, so point mutations are very significant in the long-term. If it’s an exon that’s mutated, this causes problems with even more genes down the line. 

One single TF change results in a huge change in expression. This is why “good” mutations are statistically unlikely, and also what makes long periods of stasis possible.

However, there is stabilizing selection against negative macroev changes which also produce long periods of stasis.

What if some cataclysm comes along, and only a small range of traits will save you? This is called an “ev bottleneck” - the one good mutation makes up for all the bad ones and gets you through. 

Many examples in the ev record

Cheetahs are so genetically similar that you can trade tissue between any two without rejection. Hominids have gone through a few bottlenecks too.

So how does gradualism and PE fit together?

micv - small changes in protein function
macv - large change in protein shape and networks - novel changes

Human and chimp genome - most changes in the immsys have to do with micv changes. Humans are lots more tuberculosis-resistant than chimps, chimps are more malaria-resistant. This is gradual change.

What about the macv changes? They’re in early dev. Modifying genes related to dev = massive changes in phenotype, as different as human/chimp. Often the src of most interesting changes.

Some fossil pedigrees reek of gradual change, but many others reek of PE. It’s nevertheless difficult to see macv changes in real time because the process is so slow. Some rapid change has been seen, though.

Chicago still has 1880’s rat carcasses lying around. Researchers compared them to modern rats - found tons of genetic changes in just a century.

Darwin’s finches - on Galapagos islands - gene distrib is changing and thus their phenotype.

Diabetic resistance - diabetes has two forms - junior/adult onset db - adult is more freq. If your body is built to store away a lot of nutrients, and your diet is bad, you’ll be more susceptible.

Pacific islanders have been studied, but Peema indians are more interesting.

Peema native Americans - half live in Mexico, half in US, very different diets. US dieters had 90% db rates by 30yrs old.

Mararu, Samoa - massive db rates. 
Yemen Jews - 60s moved to Israel, changed diets - db rates soared, killed off many people. Left fewer genes around. Pacific isl - db rates going down since last decade

Another ex: great genetics story - soviet geneticists in Siberia - started domesticating wild Siberian silver foxes. Selected the calmer, more docile specimens - tame as dogs after 20-30 generations. Only selected for one trait, but phenotypes changed, too.

Another ex: antibiotic resistance. Testament to rapid evol change.

You can have both gradualism and PE happening at the same time. 

Traits don’t evolve individually, they evolve in packages. Individual traits may evolve rapidly with periods of stasis, but all the traits in the pop combine to make one, big, gradualistic line.

Now that this bucket is finished, what’s next? Another world of trying to make sense of the genetics of behavior.
